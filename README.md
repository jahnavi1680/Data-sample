This is a practice Data Analysis project to refresh my pandas knowledge and to implement RFM analysis on a business data sample.

The data is obtained from kaggle datasets. It is the transaction data of a company over 25 months. It contains every payment, either made to or made by the company.
Including debt payment, amazon platform fees, customer payments, and discounts.

The project includes first performing EDA on the data, gaining insights about the data like how the sales progress is, how products are performing in countries and 
what are all the losses to the company.

Then, it will jump into performing customer segmentation using RFM analysis and then check out some other analytical methods that can be performed.
